Tasks:
1. String Transformations:
a. capitalize(str): Capitalizes the first letter of a string.
b. reverse(str): Reverses a string.
c. isPalindrome(str): Checks if a string is a palindrome (reads the same 
backward as forward).
d. wordCount(str): Counts the number of words in a string.
2. Array Transformations:
a. double(arr): Doubles every number in an array.
b. filterEven(arr): Filters out even numbers from an array.
c. sum(arr): Calculates the sum of all numbers in an array.
d. average(arr): Calculates the average of all numbers in an array.
3. Object Transformations:
a. fullName(person): Returns the full name of a person object (given 
properties firstName and lastName).
b. isAdult(person): Checks if a person is 18 or older (given property age).
c. filterByAge(people, minAge): Filters an array of person objects to keep 
only those at least minAge years old.
4. Function Composition:
a. Use the compose(...fns) function (you can find implementations online) to 
combine your functions in interesting ways. For example, create a function to 
reverse and capitalize a string, or to double all the even numbers in an array.
Evaluation:
• Code Quality:
o All functions are pure (no side effects).
o The code is well-organized, readable, and uses clear variable names.
o Functions are appropriately decomposed into smaller, reusable pieces.
o Correct handling of potential errors (e.g., empty arrays, invalid input types).
• Functionality:
o All tasks are completed, and the functions work correctly with the provided 
datasets and various inputs.
o Function composition is used effectively to create more complex 
transformations.
• Understanding:
o Demonstrate a solid grasp of functional programming concepts and how they 
apply to data manipulation.
o Explain the reasoning behind function implementations and composition 
choices
